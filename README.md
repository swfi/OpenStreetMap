## OpenStreetMap Project 

First, choose any area of the world in [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and use data wrangling techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. 
  
Second, clean the OpenStreetMap data for that part of the world.
  
Lastly, use MongoDB to store, query and aggregate the data.
