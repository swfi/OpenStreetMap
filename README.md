# OpenStreetMap Project Data Wrangling with MongoDB

### Map Area
Skåne, Sweden
* https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/54409#map=8/55.837/13.126
* https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/your-extracts/e6c75631ddab

So why this area? First, I'm interested to know how it looks like around Skåne. Second, this regoin seems unpopular, which could most probably generate uncompleted data. Therefore, it would be worth the effort to get started to work on the data somehow.
