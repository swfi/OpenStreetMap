## OpenStreetMap Project 

### Description
This project aims to use data wrangling techniques. First, choose any area of the world in [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). Then use [audit.py]() to assess the quality of the OpenStreetMap data for that part of the world for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. After cleaning the data via [clean.py](), we can finally use MongoDB to store, query and aggregate the data and discover some interesting facts. 

### Prerequisites
* Python
* MongoDB
